The model is primarily based on the work of \textcite{jordigal_2015_monetary}, \textcite{gali_2005_monetary}, and \textcite{ricci_2019_essays}. \textcite{jordigal_2015_monetary} was used to derive a baseline NK DSGE with small open economy features, while \textcite{gali_2005_monetary} was used to scale the model to a two-country DSGE model. Finally, a few Scotland-specific DSGE extensions were taken from \textcite{ricci_2019_essays} who were the first ones to build a DSGE model for Scotland and the rest of the UK (rUK). Where applicable, the notation follows \textcite{jordigal_2015_monetary}. Given that Scotland and the rest of the UK are modelled as symmetrical, we denote variables without an asterisk as Scotland-specific variables, e.g. $C_t$, while variables with an asterisk, e.g. $C^*_t$ refer to rUK variables. Finally, the rest of the World variables are denoted with two asterisks, e.g. $C^{**}_t$. It is also because the economies are assumed to be symmetrical, the following section only lists model equations for Scotland.
