\textcite{ricci_2019_essays} was the first to build a large-scale two-country DSGE model explicitly tailored to Scotland and the rest of the UK. In an attempt to retain the model's simplicity while still allowing policy analysis, this dissertation will primarily build on the work of \textcite{gali_2005_monetary} and \textcite{jordigal_2015_monetary}. In contrast, \textcite{ricci_2019_essays} model was based on the work of \textcite{rabanal_2010_eurodollar}, who were among the first to build a medium-to-large two-country DSGE model. Neither \textcite{gali_2005_monetary} nor \textcite{jordigal_2015_monetary} models considered lump-sum or distortionary taxes, or government spending, more generally. While extensive literature covers government spending in DSGE models, few to none cover government spending in a small open economy (SOE) NK DSGE model, and even fewer apply it to a two-country setting. Therefore, most of the derivations had to be carried out using a pen and paper, and step-by-step derivations are provided in the Appendix.

Moreover, the focus of this dissertation is not to build the most factually accurate model of Scotland or the United Kingdom but to assess the asymmetric responses in government spending under factual and counterfactual policy scenarios. The factual scenario refers to the Westminister government collecting taxes from all four countries of the UK and distributing them according to the Barnett formula. The counterfactual scenario refers to the Holyrood government's ability to collect tax revenue, issue bonds (borrow), and spend it at its sole discretion. We further break down the scenarios by allowing public expenses to be funded by lump-sum and distortionary (labour) taxes. This brings the number of policy scenarios considered by the dissertation to four.

Finally, in line with most of the literature, variables referring to the home country (Scotland) will be denoted without an asterisk, i.e., $Y_t$, while foreign country (the Rest of the UK or \textbf{rUK}) will be denoted with an asterisk, i.e., $Y^*_t$. Population-weighted sums of these variables will be referred to as UK-wide variables and denoted as $Y_t^{UK}$.
