Two-country small open economy NK DSGE model for Scotland and the Rest of the UK.

1. Home country: Scotland
2. Foreign country: RUK
3. Scotland and RUK are small and open economies
   1. They take world output, inflation, and consumption as given and cannot influence it
4. Scotland and RUK are assumed to be symmetrical in market structure and preferences
5. Shocks in Scotland, RUK, and in the World Economy are assumed to be correlated
6. Sticky nominal prices: Calvo Fairy
   1. Here, I would prefer to use Rotemburg as it is more intuitive and less popular than Calvo Fairy
7. For simplicity:
   1. No nontradeable goods
   2. No trading costs
   3. No possibility of international policy coordination
   4. No cost-push shocks
   5. No nominal wage rigidities
   6. No international financial assets
