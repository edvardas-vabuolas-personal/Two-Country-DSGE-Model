\section*{Two-country DSGE model for Scotland and the rest of the UK}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Home country: \textit{Scotland}
    \item  Foreign country: \textit{rUK}
    \item  Scotland and rUK are SOEs
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item They take world output, inflation, and consumption as given and cannot influence it
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Scotland and RUK are assumed to be symmetrical in market structure and preferences
    \item Shocks in Scotland, RUK, and in the World Economy are assumed to be correlated
    \item Sticky nominal prices: Calvo Fairy
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Here, I would prefer to use Rotemburg as it is more intuitive and less popular than Calvo Fairy
          \end{enumerate}
    \item For simplicity:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item No nontradeable goods
              \item No trading costs
              \item No possibility of international policy coordination
              \item No cost-push shocks
              \item No nominal wage rigidities
              \item No international financial assets
          \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
