\subsection{Government}

As mentioned in the literature review, this dissertation makes two essential assumptions related to government spending: households are assumed to be Ricardian, and; government spending is non-productive. The latter follows from the fact that government spending does not enter the utility function nor the firm's production function. Therefore, government spending is equivalent to reducing the quantity of available resources. In line with most of the literature, deviations from the steady state government spending are assumed to be temporary, i.e. following an autoregressive process of order 1, as opposed to a permanent increase considered by \textcite{baxter_1993_fiscal}. Below is a typical budget constraint faced by the government every period:
\begin{align}
 \underbrace{\E_t [R^{-1}_tB_{t+1}] + P_t T_t}_{Revenue} = \underbrace{P_tG_t + B_t}_{Spending}
\end{align}
That is, government accrues revenue by collecting taxes in current prices $P_t T_t$ and by issuing bonds at current gross return rate $\E_t [R^{-1}_tB_{t+1}]$. The government needs to pay one unit of consumption good for each mature bond issued previous period $B_t$ and pay for its spending in current prices $P_t G_t$. The government budget constraint varies depending on the policy scenario considered:

\end{table}
where $P^{UK}_t$ is a weighted sum of price levels in Scotland and the rest of the UK, i.e., $P^{UK}_t = \chi P_t + (1-\chi)P^*_t$. Similarly, a monetary union implies a single rate of gross return, which we define as $R^{UK}_t = \chi R_t + (1-\chi)R^*_t$. Also note the log-linearised government budget constraints in real terms (see Appendix \ref{eq:appendix_log_budget_constraint_derivation_beginning} - \ref{eq:appendix_log_budget_constraint_derivation_end} for derivation):

where $\rho = \beta^{-1} - 1$ pins down the steady state interest rate. In each of the scenarios, the government tax revenue is accrued either by imposing lump-sum taxes or a labour tax:

 \caption{Tax revenue under each of the policy scenarios}
\end{table}
That is, in the case of lump-sum taxes, tax revenue equals government spending; similarly, in the case of labour taxes, tax revenue is a share ($ \tau_t \in [0,1]$) of nominal labour income. However, given that the two sources of income are close substitutes for the government (it can raise revenue either by raising taxes or by issuing bonds), tax revenue and budget constraint alone do not lead to a stable equilibrium (there are many ``solutions''). The governing of this relationship is captured by a fiscal rule of the following form:
\begin{table}[H]
 \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}

 \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
 \makecell{Scen. 1 \& Scen. 3\\ G: 2, $\tau \in \{0, 1\}$} & \makecell{Scot. \\ rUK } & 
 \makecell{
 $t_t = \phi_g g_t + \phi_b b_t$\\
 $t^*_t = \phi^*_g g^*_t + \phi^*_b b^*_t$\\
 } \\ 
 \makecell{Scen. 3 \& Scen. 4\\ G: 1, $\tau \in \{0, 1\}$} & UK & 
 $t^{UK}_t = \phi^{UK}_g g^{UK}_t + \phi^{UK}_b b^{UK}_t$
 \end{tabular}
 \vspace{0.5cm}
 \caption{Fiscal rules under each of the policy scenarios}
\end{table}
where following \textcite{jordigal_2005_understanding}, we define $g_t = \frac{G_t-G}{Y}$, $b_t = \frac{(B_t/P_{t-1}) - (B/P)}{Y}$, and $t_t = \frac{T_t - T}{Y}$. The model assumes that the government's budget is balanced in the steady state, i.e. $\frac{B}{Y} = 0$. Each fiscal policy rule states that tax revenue responds to changes in government spending and government debt, where the responses depend on $\phi_b \in [0,1]$ and $\phi_g \in [0,1]$. Intuitively, setting $\phi_b$ to a value close to 1 would imply that tax revenue (and tax rate) are highly responsive to debt ($b_t$). Similarly, a high $\phi_g$ value suggests high responsiveness of tax revenue (and tax rate) to government spending ($g_t$). Plugging fiscal rules into the log-linearised government budget constraints yields:

 \makecell{Scen. 1 \& Scen. 3\\ G: 2, $\tau \in \{0, 1\}$} & \makecell{Scot. \\ rUK } & 
 \makecell{
 $b_{t+1} = (1-\rho)(1-\phi_g) g_t + (1-\rho)(1-\phi_b)b_t$\\
 $b^*_{t+1} = (1-\rho^*)(1-\phi^*_g) g^*_t + (1-\rho^*)(1-\phi^*_b)b^*_t$
 } \\ 
 \makecell{Scen. 3 \& Scen. 4\\ G: 1, $\tau \in \{0, 1\}$} & UK & 
 $b^{UK}_{t+1} = (1-\rho^{UK})(1-\phi^{UK}_g) g^{UK}_t + (1-\rho^{UK})(1-\phi^{UK}_b)b^{UK}_t$
 \end{tabular}

 \caption{Future bonds are determined by government spending and current government debt}
\end{table}
These equations determine the equilibrium path for bond supply, with \linebreak $(1-\rho)(1-\phi_b) < 1$ to ensure stability (non-explosiveness). Also, setting $\phi_g = 1$ would result in $b_t = 0$ for all $t$ and $\phi_b$, implying that government spending would have to be solely funded by lump-sum or labour taxes. Finally, note that $B_t$ is a predetermined (state) variable, meaning its value is determined in the previous period, while the initial $B_0$ value is assumed to have been determined ``historically'', a.k.a given.
